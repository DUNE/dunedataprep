# DataPrep/WctTool
David Adams  
September 2023

This directory is intended to hold dataprep tools wrapping wirecell code.
Unfortunately, it turns out to be very difficult to use wirecell tools outside the wirecell framework
and no tools are yet constructed.
The test directory has an executable that tries to use wirecell code.
For more information, see [issue 23](https://github.com/DUNE/dunedataprep/issues/23).
