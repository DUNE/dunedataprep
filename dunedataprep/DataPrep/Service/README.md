September 2023

This directory contains dataprep services (art services).
Most are obsolete and were replaced by tools many years ago whe dataprep was upgraded.
The exceptions are:

ToolBasedRawDigitPrepService ([header](ToolBasedRawDigitPrepService.h), [source](ToolBasedRawDigitPrepService_service.cc))
is called by the dataprep modules (see [../Modules](../Modules))
